"""mbt v2 deploy — pack built modules into one LINKLIB XMIT and RECEIVE it.

The build leaves a per-module IEBCOPY unload build/{NAME}.iebcopy for every
module it links.  Unlike a bare load module, the unload carries the PDS2
directory (entry point + module length), so ld370 --pack can combine the
unloads into one multi-member LINKLIB XMIT with every member intact.
The module set follows the build:

    make clean && make ufsd && make deploy   -> LINKLIB with just UFSD
    make            && make deploy            -> LINKLIB with all modules

Steps:
  1. ld370 --pack <build/NAME.iebcopy ...> -o build/{PROJECT}.deploy -xmit
     --dsn {TARGET}    (one or many modules; entry/modlen come from the
     .iebcopy directories)
  2. upload build/{PROJECT}.deploy.xmit to staging ({HLQ}.MBT.XMIT.IN)
  3. DELETE the target LINKLIB if it exists  (NJE RECEIVE refuses to
     merge into an existing dataset -> "replace" semantics)
  4. TSO RECEIVE staging -> target  (allocates the target from the XMIT's
     saved attributes, so no SPACE calculation is needed)
  5. delete the staging dataset

The RECEIVE job's spool is kept in build/receive.spool, and its poll scales
with the XMIT (MBT_DEPLOY_TIMEOUT overrides) -- a poll that expires while the
RECEIVE is still writing would report a failed deploy, and the obvious retry
deletes the dataset that job is filling.

Target LINKLIB (first match wins):
  1. --target on the command line
  2. [deploy] target = "..." in project.toml
  3. {HLQ}.{PROJECT_NAME}.{VRM}.LINKLIB   (default; e.g.
     IBMUSER.UFSD.V1R0M0D.LINKLIB for ufsd 1.0.0-dev)

Exit codes:
  0  success
  1  pack (ld370) failure
  2  config/validation error
  4  mainframe / RECEIVE error
