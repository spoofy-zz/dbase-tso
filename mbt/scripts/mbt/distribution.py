"""SMP4 distribution descriptor -- parse, validate, assemble the SYSMOD.

Turns the `[distribution]` table of a project.toml into the text artifacts an
operator needs to install the product on MVS 3.8j through SMP **Release 4**
(GC28-0673-6) -- not SMP/E: there are no CSI zones, no DDDEFs and no data
element type here.

The delivery model, measured on a live system in the `smptest` prototype:

    ld370 binds on the host, SMP copies on MVS.

`++MOD(x) LKLIB(dd)` combined with a **COPY** style `++JCLIN` (an IEBCOPY step,
not a link-edit step) makes SMP copy the finished load module instead of
re-binding it, so AC, RENT/REUS and the entry point survive exactly as ld370
set them.  Text members (PROC, PARMLIB, sample JCL) travel as `++MAC` steered
by `DISTLIB()`/`SYSLIB()`.

Everything in this module is pure: it takes parsed TOML plus file contents and
returns strings.  File, archive and template handling lives in mbtdist.py.
