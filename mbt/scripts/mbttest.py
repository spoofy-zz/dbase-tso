"""mbt v2 test-mvs -- deploy [[test]] modules to a TESTLIB and run them on MVS.

Each [[test]] builds a standalone load module (build/NAME.iebcopy). This driver:
  1. packs the built test modules into one TESTLIB XMIT and RECEIVEs it into
     {HLQ}.{PROJECT}.{VRM}.TESTLIB (separate from the production LINKLIB, so
     'make deploy' stays clean and tests are never shipped)
  2. generates build/test-runner.jcl: per test a BATCH step (EXEC PGM=) and a
     TSO step (IKJEFT01 CALL), STEPLIB = TESTLIB + LINKLIB, COND=EVEN, so one
     failure never blocks the rest
  3. submits it, parses each step's RC (IEF142I/IEF450I) and each leg's
     "N/M passed (K failed)" summary
  4. prints a per-test matrix and exits nonzero if any test failed -- unless
     no step got a verdict at all, which is a job-level fault (JCL error,
     expired poll, unreadable spool) and is reported as such instead of as
     failed tests.  A step left without a verdict by a *partial* readback is
     shown as `??` and counted as neither pass nor fail.

Tests LOAD data modules (IRXANCHR/IRXPARMS/IRXTSPRM/...) at runtime; those live
in the production LINKLIB, hence the STEPLIB concatenation TESTLIB+LINKLIB. The
production LINKLIB must exist -- run 'make deploy' before 'make test-mvs'.

Exit codes: 0 all passed; 2 config/validation; 4 mainframe error (including a
runner job that did not run, and one whose output could not be read back);
1 tests failed.
