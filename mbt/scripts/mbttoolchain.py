"""mbt v2 toolchain -- resolve the cc370/libc370 git refs a build checks out.

Reads the optional [toolchain] section of project.toml and prints one git ref
per toolchain repository, so a release is built against a declared version
instead of whatever the default branch happened to be at that minute:

    [toolchain]
    libc370 = "1.0.2"   # bare version -> tag v1.0.2
    cc370   = "main"    # cc370 has no releases yet

Both keys are optional and both default to 'main', so a project that declares
nothing keeps today's floating behaviour and the consumers can be migrated one
at a time.

Only release.yml consumes this.  build.yml stays on 'main' deliberately: a
floating toolchain on PRs is the early warning that catches a cc370 or libc370
regression before it reaches a consumer.  Pinning it there would hide the break
until someone bumps the version (issue #67).

The same declaration is also the build's requirement on the *installed*
libc370, because it states one thing -- "this project is built with libc370
X.Y.Z" -- that CI reproduces exactly and a working copy need only satisfy:

    make, make lib, make test    sysroot >= the declared version
    make release / prerelease    the same, plus a warning when it is newer

Nothing is checked when no version is declared, or when the value is a
branch/SHA rather than a version: there is then nothing to compare, so an
existing project changes behaviour only once it pins deliberately.

A sysroot *older* than the declaration fails either way -- the pinned runtime
was demonstrably not what the build linked.  A *newer* one only warns on a
release: `make release` bumps and tags, then release.yml checks out the pin
and rebuilds, so the local sysroot never reaches the published artifact.
Demanding an exact match would force a downgrade before every release for a
mismatch CI catches by itself (#71).

Usage:
    python3 mbttoolchain.py [--project project.toml] [--repo NAME]
    python3 mbttoolchain.py --check [--exact] [--sysroot DIR]

Output (stdout, one KEY=VALUE per line -- suited to >> "$GITHUB_ENV"):
    CC370_REF=main
    LIBC370_REF=v1.0.2

With --repo NAME the bare ref of that one repository is printed instead.
Errors and warnings go to stderr so stdout stays a clean data channel.
